# StudentManagementSystemUsingJavaAndSQL
The Student Management System is a console-based Java application developed to manage student records efficiently using JDBC for database connectivity and SQL for data persistence. The system allows administrators to perform complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student information in a relational database.

**Key Features:**

✅Add new student records with details such as Student ID, Name, Marks, and CGPA

✅View all student records stored in the database

✅Update existing student information based on Student ID

✅Delete student records securely from the database

✅Input validation and exception handling for reliable execution

**Technologies Used:**

💠Java (Core Java)

💠JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

💠SQL (MySQL / relational database)

💠Eclipse IDE

**Technical Implementation:**

💠Established database connection using JDBC DriverManager

💠Used PreparedStatement for executing parameterized SQL queries

💠Implemented SQL operations: INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE

💠Applied OOP principles such as encapsulation through Java model classes

💠Handled runtime exceptions using try-catch blocks

**Outcome:**

✅Gained hands-on experience in Java–database integration

✅Improved understanding of SQL query execution via JDBC

✅Strengthened concepts of CRUD operations and backend application flow
